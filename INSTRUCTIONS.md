## Dependencies

To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

0. Install Conda via Command Line
Anaconda is a distribution of Python that aims to simplify package management and deployment. The main use for Anaconda in this repository would be the creation of an isolated environment to install your deep learning packages and dependencies into.
	- [Official Guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install)
    - [Youtube Guide for MAC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWVTO_69U4c&t=35s)

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd   # or drlnd_gpu 
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd          # or drlnd_gpu 
	```
	
2. Follow the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/openai/gym) to perform a minimal install of OpenAI gym.  
	- Next, install the **classic control** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#classic-control) using `pip install gym[classic_control]`.
	- Then, install the **box2d** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#box2d) using `pip install gym[box2d]`.

3. If you would like to run your projects with CUDA GPU, you can install relevant CUDA & pytorch packages via [the instructions here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). **You can verify if CUDA is used by PyTorch by running `torch.cuda.is_available()` in your python script.**

4. Clone the repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git
cd deep-reinforcement-learning/python

# NOTE: You may need to comment out pytorch version 0.4.0 in requirements.txt, and manually install latest pytorch using pip install torch to prevent weird installation errors (Manually installing 0.4.0 may causes jupyter notebook hanging error). 
# NOTE: This will install the GPU-related dependencies. Please refer to base Udacity repo for CPU version. 
pip install .  
pip install torch==1.9.0+cu111 torchvision==0.10.0+cu111 torchaudio==0.9.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install tensorflow tensorboard 		# For tensorboard visualization 
```

5. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drlnd` environment.  
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
```

6. Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the `drlnd` environment by using the drop-down `Kernel` menu. <br>


**NOTE:** You may notice that code cells may not execute as expected (E.g. Hangs for no reason). Please check `python/requirements.txt` to ensure that the appropriate tensorflow & pytorch packages are installed.

![Kernel][image2]


**NOTE:** Alternatively, you may initialize your conda environment from the .yml files if it suits your hardware: 
```bash
cd drl_algorithms_collection
conda env create -f drlnd_gpu_env.yml
```
